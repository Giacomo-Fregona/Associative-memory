# Associative-memory

Here you find my project for the course Introduzione alla teoria delle reti neurali [introduction to neural networks theory], Prof Marco Budinich, UniTS, 2020. In the oral part of the course we had to present a project on a chosen topic from the course. You can have a look at the program of the course at https://wwwusers.ts.infn.it/~mbh/Prog_2020-2021_2.pdf. My project was about associative memories, that are neural networks that can store information and be queried in an associative way. In particular, I wrote a code that creates an associative memory able to store greyscale images and reconstruct damaged images.
In this repository I placed my codes, test and examples written in MatLab.
